Till now we have learnt how to play around with directories but most of the time the most important thing for a user is how to copy files,rename them or move them from one directory to another.In this tutorial we are going to learn about commands that help in file copying,renaming and moving.

1.<green>cp</green>:This command is used to copy files from one place to another.This can also be used for copying multiple files at the same time.

<blue>Usagei<blue>:cp option file(1) file(2) file(3)......file(n) destination_folder
<blue>Example</blue>:A small point to remember is that <red>~</red> is the name of the home directory(try <green>echo ~ </green>).After loging out of chroot also do try out this ...it will display the home directory.Coming back to cp,the address of files and destination must be properly given,otherwise you could end up losing data.
Some of the main options for copy are:
<green>-v</green>:<red>verbose</red>--explains what is going on.Its better for it to be interactive so that you dont end up doing something that you dont want.
<green>-r</green>:<red>recursively</red>--mostly used for directory coping.

2.<green>mv</green>:This command has a double advantage.It can be used to move files from one directory to another and also it can be used for renaming of files.

<blue>Usage:</blue>
a.To move a file:<green>mv options file1 file2 file3 ... destination</green>(last word is always the destination)
b.To rename a file:<green>mv options file1 file2 </green>(changing name from file1 to file2--observe that basically you are moving the file within the same directory because if no directory is specified it assumes that it is the PWD.)
<blue>Example</blue>:Look around and see if u can find any files to cp and mv around using these commands.Refer the man pages for more information.

3.<green>clear</green>:Clear is used to clean the terminal screen and get it neat and empty again.<green>Ctrl+l</green> is the keyboard shortcut for clear command.

<blue>Usage</blue>:clear

So this tutorial was intended to get the basic hurdles out of the way.From now we will move further and take a step towards more complicated commands.
