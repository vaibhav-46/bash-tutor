<red>
In this chapter we are going to cover some miscallaneous commands that might be used once in a while to understand about the vaious applications:

1.<green>ifconfig</green>:This command is often used to configure a network interface.It is used at boot time to set up interfaces as necessary.
<blue>
Example:ifconfig <interface name>
If no arguments are given it displays the status of the currently active interfaces.If a single interface argument is given,it displays the status of the given interface only.Some of the common options for ifconfig are:
a.<green>-a</green>:displays all interfaces which are currently available,even if down
b.<green>-s</green>:display a short list</blue>

2.<green>uname</green>:This prints the system information.Again this has various options that can be used to get some particular output.
<blue>
Some of the common options of uname are:
a.<green>-a</green>:it displays all information
b.<green>-s</green>:prints the kernel information
c.<green>-p</green>:prints the processor type
d.<green>-o</green>: prints the operating system </blue>
Thus uname with any of these informations can be really useful in getting required system info.

We have covered some commands like <green> df </green> which help in getting information about system.Some other commands that are used to extract system information from the terminal are

3.<green>glxinfo</green>:This command is used to ge details about OpenGL,the Xserver and your graphics card.Sometimes this is useful to see if the graphics card is working/responding.

4.<green>lspci</green>:This command displays a list of all PCI devices.It basically is related to audio components.It displays information about PCI bses in the system and devices connected to them.
<blue>
Usage:lspci [options]
Example:Try this <green> lspci | grep Audio </green>.This tells the user the audio card in use at that time.
</blue>

5.<green>lsusb</green>:This command displays all the USB buses and attached devices.Some of the main options for lsusb are:
<blue>
a.<green>-v</green>:this option tells lsusb to be verbose and display detailed information about the various devices.
b.,green>-s</green>:it shows only devices in specified bus and/or devnum.
</blue>

6.<green>uptime</green>:This command is used to display the urrent time elapsed since last reboot,users and load avarage.

7.<green>cat /proc/meminfo </green>:This is essentially useful in case of finding out about the momory in the system.
