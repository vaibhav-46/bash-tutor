This is a small collection of chapters that are contained as part of bash-tutor.This package contains 2 scripts as of now:

1.navigate.sh: This script is used to move around in the tutorial.
2.start.sh:This script is used to print the first chapter in the tutorial.

The navigate.sh file will be sourced from the bashrc file inside the chroot.This way the user will be able to access all the functions of that file.For now we have to manually source the navigate.sh file.

Usage:
1.Move to the folder
2. ./start.sh gives the first chapter
3. give the command----" source navigate.sh "
4.Now you can use the functions:
   next
   prev
   goto


To do list:

1.Finish the other chapters.
2.Improve the UI using ncurses.
3.Make the scripts more representable .
4.Improve the navigate.sh and bashtutor.sh scripts with vimplates and make it more user friendly.
5.Make the output scrollable
