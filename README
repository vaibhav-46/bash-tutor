This direc now contains a few basic tutorials and a parser along with a few scripts that can help in moving through the tutorial
It contains the following:

1.Func called next.sh
2.Func called resume.sh
3.Script to move through the chroot
4.A python parser

But there is a small point with this parser..there should not be any lines of the form <clour><another colour>blah</another colour></colour> i.e if a colour is defined there has to be a text within it on both sides of the child tags
<colour>data<tag>foo</tag>blah</colour> is a necissity
