<start><cyan>\t\t\t\tChapter 20----Some Interesting commands</cyan>
<white>
In this chapter we are going to cover a few commands that are randomly used in various scripts.

1.<green>date</green>:Just as the name suggests this command is used to display the date and time in various formats and of various files.

Some common <red>options</red> of date are
a.<green>-d</green>:This command is used along with string to give the whole date format.(try <green>date -d 21-july-2007 </green> )
b.<green>-r</green>:This command is used to find the <red>last modified time of file</red>.

This is all right but most of the times we want the date in a particular format...date command offers a lot of formats that we can use.Note that we have to use a '+' and then use the format ( ex. <red> date option +format</red> )

Some of the most used formats are:
a.<green>%a</green>:gives locale's abbreviated weekday name
b.<green>%B</green>:locale's full month name
c.<green>%c</green>:locale's date and time
d.<green>%D</green>:date same as %m/%d/%y (those are obvious enough)
e.<green>%F</green>:full date;same as %Y-%m-%d
f.<green>%T</green>:time ;same as %H:%M:%S

Thus we see that we can print the date and time in various formats in various colours too.

2.<green>id</green>:This command is used to find out the id of various users and groups.
<blue>Usage:id</blue>

Once you open the terminal(outside the tutorial) the thing displayed on the terminal is something like this 
<red> username@machine-name:$ </red>
This option is stored as the variable <red>PS1</red> and it can be modified.Also suppose you type in <green> ls \ </green>,it gives a promt generally <green>'>'</green>.This is stored in the variable <red>PS2</red>.Try to <red>echo $PS1 and $PS2</red>.When we echo PS1 we get something like this
 <red> '\[\e]0;\u@\h: \w\a\]${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\]\$' </red>(outside the tutorial).Now what does this stand for..before analysing this we will see some special escape characters:

1.<green>'\a'</green>:an ascii bell character
2.<green>'\d'</green>:date (u can even use the various formats)
3.<green>'\e'</green>:an ASCII escape charcter(like 033 given in echo chapter)
4.<green>'\H'</green>:The host name
5.<green>'\t'</green>:time in 24 hour format('T' denotes 12 hour format)
6.<green>'\u'</green>:username of current user
7.<green>'\w'</green>:basename of current working directory
8.<green>'\['</green>:This begins a sequence of non-printing characters which could be used to embed a terminal con-trol sequence into the prompt
9.<green>'\]'</green>:This ends a sequence of non-printing characters

Now armed with all this information,we can analyse the PS1 variable.Do try playing around with it,you will learn a lot.
