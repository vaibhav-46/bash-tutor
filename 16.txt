<start><title>Chapter 15----Process The Processes!!!</title>
<white>
In this chapter we are going to help reduce the usage of the mouse.Suppose we have started a program say Firefox and we want to shut it down.How do we do that using the terminal?Please read the whole chapter before you start trying out anything on your own.
      First thing that you must know is that every process that runs on the computer has a unique id(a very useful id).Suppose we want to start firefox<red>(do it outside the tutorial)</red> from the terminal.This can be done by using the name firefox on the terminal.But then as long as Firefox is open we cannot use the terminal to do anything else(note that pressing <red>Ctrl+z</red> in the teminal closes the firefox window).So to start firefox in the background so that it does not interfere with the terminal use the command <green>firefox & </green>(note the & symbol..not a typo error!!).The & tells the computer to run the script in the background.Also the output on the terminal gives a number which is the process id of that application.This number is very important as this number uniquely identifies the application on the computer.

Now that we have understood about process id,we will see some commands that use these ids:

1.<green>pidof </green>:This is a useful command to know about the process id of a process.

<blue>Example</blue>:Start firefox and then type in the terminal <green> pidof firefox-bin</green>.You can also use a tab to complete the application name!

2.<green>ps</green>:The process status command reports a snapshot of the current process.This can be used to find all the process running at a time including their process identification numbers.

<blue>Usage</blue>: ps [options]
<blue>Examples</blue>:
a.ps without options prints to stdout four items of information for atleast two processes currently on the system:the shell and ps.The four items are labelled <red>PID,TTY,TIME and CMD</red>.<red>TIME</red> is the amount of CPU time in minutes and seconds that the process has been running.<red>CMD</red> is the name of the command that launched the process.<red>TTY</red> (stands for terminal type ) is the name of the terminal that the user is logged into.
b.<green>ps -aux | less </green> is the most common option that is used to obtain information about all the process.<red>-a</red> option tells the user to list all the process of all the users on the system.<red>-u</red> tells ps to provide detailed information about each process.The <red>-x</red> option adds to the list processes that have no controlling terminal(such as those which were started on booting).Note that the <red>-</red> is not mandatory here.
c.<green>ps -ef | less </green> is an alternative to the above command.The <red>-e</red> option generates a list of information about every process currently running.The <red>-f</red> option generates a listing that contains fewer items of information for each process than the -l option.

3.<green>jobs</green>:This command prints all the background process that are running.This can be helpful to find out if any malfunctioning proram is running in the background.

4.<green>bq</green>:This command is used to get a program to run in the background.
<blue>bg [options]</blue>.

5.<green>kill</green>:This command is used to kill a process that is malfunctioning.But to kill a process the id of the process is required.Only then this command can be used.Basically kill sends a sort of warning to the application and based on the intensity of the warning the application takes action.(see examples) 

<blue>Usage</blue>:kill procedd_id
<blue>Example</blue>:Start a process and find its process_id.Now kill the process using the command <green> kill process_id </green>
Also note that <green> kill -l </green> can be used to find all the signals that kill can send to various process.

6.<green>pkill</green>:This command will send the specified signal ( by default SIGTERM)to each process instead of listing them on stdout.

<blue>Usage</blue>:pkill [options]

7.<green>killall</green>:This command is used to kill the process by name.

<blue>Usage</blue>:killall [options] name

These commands are used a lot in managing the running of various applications.
