Well you see your friend's computer and like the gmail-notifier that he has.You want it for yourself too but how do you get it...Synaptic Manager(System-->Administration-->Synaptic manager)ofcourse.But then is there a command that can be used to do so?Synaptic Manager() has the list of various applications that are available in the repository that you are connected to.But what if we want to get the applications using the terminal?Obviously are useful to do exctly that.Note that most of this commands require you to be super user.So you can use sudo before the command.

1.<green>apt-get install</green>:This command is used to install the package that you need.
<blue>Usage</blue>:sudo apt-get install {package}

2.<green>apt-get remove</green>:This command is used to remove some packages that are already installed but this does not remove the configuration files.
<blue>Usage</blue>:sudo apt-get remove {package}

3.<green>apt-get --purge remove</green>:This command is used to used to remove installed packages along with the configurational files.
<blue>Usage</blue>:sudo apt-get --purge remove {package}

4.<green>apt-get update</green>:This command is used to upgrade the distribution including new security updates.It also resynchronizes the package index files.
<blue>Usage</blue>:sudo apt-get update

5.<green>apt-cache search </green>:This command is used to search for all packages having some pattern as part of the file name.
<blue>Usage</blue>:sudo apt-cache search pattern

These commands are pretty useful in getting various applications from the repository and also later when we want to get an application from the source code.
In case you dont understand something or if something does not work you can read up about <red>/etc/apt/sources.list</red> and if you are further interested read up on <red> dpkg</red>.
