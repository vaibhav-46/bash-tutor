Once ypu get your computer goiong on,you would like some applications that can make your work easier.There is something called Synaptic Manager(System-->Administration-->Synaptic manager) that has the list of various applications that are available in the repository that you are connected through.But what if we want to get the applications using the terminal.Some of these commands are useful to do exctly that.Note that most of this commands require you to be super user.So you can use sudo before the command.

1.<green>apt-get install</green>:This command is used to install the package that you need.
<blue>
Usage:sudo apt-get install {package}</blue>

2.<green>apt-get remove</green>:This command is used to remove some packages that are already installed but this does not remove the configuration files.
<blue>
Usage:sudo apt-get remove {package}</blue>

3.<green>apt-get --purge remove</green>:This command is used to used to remove installed packages along with the configurational files.
<blue>
Usage:sudo apt-get --purge remove {package} </blue>

4.<green>apt-get update</green>:This command is used to upgrade the distribution including new security updates.It also resynchronizes the package index files.
<blue>
Usage:sudo apt-get update</blue>

5.<green>apt-cache search </green>:This command is used to search for all packages having some pattern as part of the file name.

These commands are pretty useful in getting various applications from the repository and also later when we want to get an application from the source code.
