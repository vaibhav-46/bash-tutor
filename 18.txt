Some of the important points about vim are:

a.Searching is done using <red>/</red>.To find next <red>n</red> and previous <red>N</red>.To replace use <red>%s/this/that</red>.
b.Saving and exiting can be done using:
<green>:q</green>:Exit the tutorial 
<green>:wq!</green>:Save and exit
<green>:q!</green>:Exit and throw away changes
c.Copying can be done using <red>c</red> and pasting can be done using <red>p</red>.


2.<green>Emacs</green>:Vim is more like a text editor but Emacs can do a lot of other things along with text editing.It can even set up your social status from the terminal... ;). Other than that well I dont know much about it either... :( .
